# web_scraping_challenge
The part_1_mars_news jupyter notebook has the code for part 1 of the challenge. The part_2_mars_weather
jupyter notebook has the code for part 2 of the challenge, this notebook also has my written analysis. For both
part 1 and part 2 I used the starter code provided. The mars.csv is the exported df from part 2 of the challenge.
